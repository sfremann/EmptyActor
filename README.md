# EmptyActor
Very simple UE plugin defining an empty actor for C++

## About

Very simple plugin defining an empty C++ actor. When spawning an actor from C++ in Unreal, it does not have a scene root. I made this simple class to be able to spawn an actor with a scene root and apply transforms to it.

> [!WARNING]  
> Supported Unreal versions: 5.4. (Did not try with older versions.)
